# Emotion-Recognition

## Introduction
This is a machine learning project which aims to recognize human emotions through facial features. The model has been successfully implemented inside of a desktop application which can now recognize human emotions through a live web camera feed or a video of your choice.

## Build Instructions

### Machine Learning Model

### Desktop Application
The desktop application was designed using Pyqt library along with OpenCV for video and web camera feed. The following dependencies are :- PySide2, Pyqt6, opencv. You must have these dependencies if you want to build the application from source. 

There is a model included in the app directory, along with the xml file which are necessary for running the application.

Then 
    cd app
    python3 app.py

Now you should be able to see a new window on your screen.
